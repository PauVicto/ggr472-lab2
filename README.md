Summary of Vic's First WebMap
</summary>
 This project builds upon the webpage developed in Lab 1 by integrating an interactive web map created using Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS. The original GeoJSON download buttons were removed and replaced with an embedded web map that visualizes a “day in the life” route taken to attend the GGR472 class on Wednesdays.

The map traces movement from home to Icha Tea Café, onward to Sidney Smith Hall for class, and later toward an additional café and park along the route, representing both structured and leisure-oriented segments of the day. The route is symbolized using differentiated line styling to distinguish movement before and after class.

In addition, a separate navigation dropdown links to a supplementary map that displays a broader collection of my favorite study spaces, cafés, picnic areas, and class locations derived from earlier GeoJSON datasets. Together, these maps contextualize everyday student mobility within the campus and surrounding urban environment.
